Evolve Legacy Reborn Launcher Help:
   | --update           Deploy launcher update. Do not use this yourself, this is just for internal usage
-O | --do-onboarding    (Re-)run the onboarding process (setup game location, import progress, setup username)
-M | --no-manager       Don't use the EvolveN3NManager Background Service, instead ask for elevation when launching the game
-N | --network          Use a custom network instead of the default one called "main". Usage: --network 1234
-B | --bin64            Point the launcher to a custom location for the bin64_SteamRetail folder. Usage: --bin64 path/to/EvolveGame/bin64_SteamRetail

Any arguments that are not listed here will be forwarded to Evolve when launching the Game!



Originally wanted to have this as a help command, couldn't figure out how to print stuff to the console in a windows GUI app though,
std::cout didn't work even with AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS)...
